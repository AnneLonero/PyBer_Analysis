# PyBer_Analysis# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The project analyze and visualize Pyber ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib. This analysis requires us to merge two dataframes, then look into ride-sharing data by city type, and later create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Result:
Below is a dataframe summary after calculate total rides, drivers and fares, as well as average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

According to this dataframe, rural area has the least total rides and drivers which means the total fares is lower than other city types. However, rural area has much higher average fare per ride and per driver than other city types. For example, the rural average fare per ride is 1.1 times more than suburban and 1.4 times more than urban, and average fare per driver in rural areas is 1.4 times higher than suburban and 3.3 times higher than urban areas. Urban area has the highest number of rides, and drivers but lowver average fare per ride and driver compare to rural and suburban respectively.

The multiple-line graph below shows the total weekly fare for each city type for  period from January to April 2019.

Urban area has the highest weekly total fare, about 9 and 2.25 times higher than rural and suburban weekly total fares. All areas have a slight increase in total fares toward the end of Febuarary, but no other trend was identified.


## Summary:
Recommendations after this analysis include look into the increase accross all city type and potentional expand the time range of the analysis to identify more trend to better prepare for future peak time. Ideally, we want to close the gap of the average fare per ride between the city type. Therefore, more datasource could be collected for future analysis to identify the improvement opportunity; for example, phone service quality, or number of equipments available for each city.
